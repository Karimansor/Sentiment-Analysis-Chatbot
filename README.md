# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis and Simple Chatbot

This notebook demonstrates two main tasks:

1.  **Movie Review Sentiment Analysis**:
    -   Trains a Logistic Regression model to classify movie reviews from the IMDb dataset as positive or negative.
    -   Uses TF-IDF for feature extraction.
    -   Includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model and vectorizer.
    -   Provides a simple chatbot interface for real-time sentiment prediction.

2.  **Simple Chatbot for Answering Questions**:
    -   Develops a basic chatbot using both a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), LSTM, and GRU models and a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model.
    -   The chatbot is trained on a small dataset of question-answer pairs.
    -   Demonstrates text tokenization, padding, model building, training, and generating responses.
